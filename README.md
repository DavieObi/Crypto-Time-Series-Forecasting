# Crypto Time Series Forecasting

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive time series forecasting project for predicting cryptocurrency prices (or a related metric) using historical data. The project employs a structured data science workflow, including outlier detection, feature engineering, and training various models, specifically **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)**.

The entire process is designed to be executed via a single Python script (`src/pipeline.py`) for easy reproducibility.

## Features

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling of time series data and feature creation.
* **Outlier Detection:** Uses **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)** for identifying anomalies.
* **Model Training:** Implementation of statistical models like ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing.
* **Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation using time series cross-validation techniques.
* **Model Persistence:** Trained models are saved using `joblib`.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Crypto-Time-Series-Forecasting.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Crypto-Time-Series-Forecasting.git)
cd Crypto-Time-Series-Forecasting
````

### 2\. Create and Activate Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Using conda
conda create -n crypto_forecast python=3.10
conda activate crypto_forecast
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Install all necessary libraries using the provided `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

After setup, run the main pipeline script from the project root directory:

```bash
python src/pipeline.py
```

This script will:

1.  Load data from `data/Cryptocurrency_History_Data.arff`.
2.  Process and engineer features.
3.  Train the ARIMA model.
4.  Evaluate performance and save plots to the `reports/figures/` directory.
5.  Save the trained model as `models/arima_model.pkl`.

## Results (Example)

| Model | RMSE | MAE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ARIMA (2,1,0)** | 1.25 | 0.98 |
| Exponential Model | 1.32 | 1.05 |

*See `reports/figures/` for detailed performance plots and forecast visualizations.*

## Built With

  * Python 3.10+
  * Pandas, NumPy
  * Scikit-learn (for LOF)
  * Statsmodels (for ARIMA)
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn
